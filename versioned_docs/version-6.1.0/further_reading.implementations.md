If you happen to work with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/) or [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) in your project, you’re lucky! There are already great lightweight wrappers implemented for `a11y-dialog`:

- [react-a11y-dialog](https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/react-a11y-dialog)
- [vue-a11y-dialog](https://github.com/morkro/vue-a11y-dialog)
